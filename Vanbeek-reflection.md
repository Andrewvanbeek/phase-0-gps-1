What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

It was really helpful.  I think for the most part I understand how Git works, I will say that git conflicts make sense on paper but I have to memorize the workflow for solving them.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Github functionality vs git local functionality for example a local pull request vs a github pull request was helpful in that I now know the added benefit of the physical merge button on github.


What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked about conflicts and also about a lot of shortcuts within Git.  I now know that git add . adds all files.  

What still confuses you about Git?

I think conflicts and reverting to prior forms still confuse.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
-The GPS was a really positive experience.  My Guide was great.
